                <p>
                    In Palia, humans are the legendary race, having disappeared 
                    thousands of years ago at the height of their grandeur and 
                    mastery of magic. Nobody in the modern day knows why. 
                    One day, humans begin to reappear all over the world. 
                    As one of the newly re-emerged humans, players will have to 
                    make themselves a new home in this friendly world, and forge 
                    a future for themselves and humanity.<sup>[1]</sup>
